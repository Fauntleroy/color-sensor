Proximity Color Sensor

---
# What Will We Build?
_This is a very basic project that combines an ultrasonic sensor with an RGB LED and a 
photoresistor to roughly estimate the color of nearby objects. We will do all of the programming
in JavaScript (Node.js), and it will be absolutely wonderful._

# How to Get Started?
_You should make sure you have the following items available before proceeding:_

 * Fancy-pants computer with USB ports and everything
 * [Arduino UNO](http://amzn.to/13SRAPN) or compatible development board
 * Three (3) approximately 220 Ohm resistors *
 * [HC-SR04](http://amzn.to/ZlP1gF) Ultrasonic rangefinder
 * Common cathode [RGB LED](http://amzn.to/Zju4HT)
 * 1k Ohm resistor *
 * Photoresistor
 * USB cable
 * Jumpers

_If you are purchasing resistors, it is best to buy a [resistor kit](http://amzn.to/11iFoBI) with various resistance values_
